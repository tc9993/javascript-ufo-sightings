<h1>The Truth IS Out There</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>
  The purpose of this analysis was to assist a friend, Dana, with creating an interactive webpage that would allow for her to display and filter different accounts of UFO Sightings.  By using Javascript within an HTML document with CSS for style, we were able to put together a table that can be fitlered by a variety of different factors.
</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>
With the webpage, you are able to filter the results based on date, city, state, country, and/or ufo shape.  By simply selecting one of the provided input fields and entering in the information you want to filter down to, and then clicking outside the filter, you can interact with the table data and hone in on what you are looking for.  In order to re-populate the entire table you must delete any data in the inputs.

<h2>Summary</h2>

<h3>Drawback</h3>
<p>
  The biggest drawback to this page is the lack of a 'Clear Filters' button at this time.  Without that, manual intervention in the form of clearing individual inputs is required to repopulate the entire table.
</p>

<h3>Further Recommendations</h3>
<p>
  To further develop this page, I have two suggestions for the time being:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make the filters read text live.  At present, you must input the desired information and then unfocus the input for the table to then filter the data.  Developing the inputs to read inputs live could more quickly filter the table down and reduce the number of keystrokes required to filter the table as desired.</li>
  <li>Make the filters not case-sensitive.  For now you must input the data using all lower case letters as that matches the data in the table.  Allowing for matching filters with table data regardless of case-sensitivity would be a rather big improvement considering the data mostly contains proper nouns which users will be accustomed to capitalizing.</li>
</ol>
